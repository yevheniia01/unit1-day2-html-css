        <p> My name is Yevheniia, I was born in Ukraine. In big city Kiev.
                I came to United States in 2016, right now I live
                in Cary North Carolina. I love this place and probably will stay here forever. I have a little daughter and 
                loving husband. I dont have much codding background,
                but I was studying HTML, CSS, JAVA Script and SQL at CodeAcademy website.
                It was great source for me. 
                As I said originally from Ukraine, I was working as daycare teacher, also attended to University where
                was studying program engineering for two years, 
                I have had to quit my University since were prepearing
                to move to United States.
                Also I really love animals, my favorites are reptiles. I have amazing bearded dragon, and had Veiled Chameleons in the past.
                I can spend a lot of time with them.</p>
